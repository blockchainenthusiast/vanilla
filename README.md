Hoping to install Vanilla OS on Apple Silicone
My first repository! Now that we can run linux on the Apple's hardware, I want to install an immutable os so that I can keep my personal docs and preferences on mobile storage and not worry about my os being tampered with while I'm gone. In the future perhaps mobile storage will turn into ipfs or blockchain storage?
